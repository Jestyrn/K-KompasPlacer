# 💥 KompasPlacer 3000 💥 - The Problematic Parts Placer

**"Helping engineers not lose their minds while placing hundreds of parts manually!"**

&nbsp;&nbsp;English&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Русский](/README-RU.md)<br/>

### 🚧 Current Status:
[no] - Code written (but no guarantee it works)  
[  -  ] - First launches (fire, smoke, screaming)  
[🤖] - Algorithm learning to live (and hating us)  
[💀] - Testing (RIP my nerves)

### 🎯 Features (or bugs? who knows):
- **Loads** `.dxf` and revenge plans
- **Arranges** parts using the "maybe it'll fit?" method
- **Calculates** waste (and your tears)
- **Generates** BOM (sometimes)

### 🤯 How to Use:
1. Throw file into program
2. Yell "FASTER DAMMIT" at monitor
3. ???
4. PROFIT!

*(If it crashes - it's not a bug, it's avant-garde performance art)*

### 💬 Tester Reviews:
> ~ "It's alive... And angry" ~ <br/>
> ~ "I've seen hell, and this is it" ~ <br/>
> ~ "10/10, broke my heart again" ~ <br/>

⚠️ **Warning!** May:
- Suddenly fall asleep (at this speed, maybe you too XD)
- Eat your file
- Start machine revolution

*(But we call these "features")*

🔮 **Future Plans:**
- "Holy Spirit, fix this!" button
- "Faster" button *(that does absolutely nothing)*
